h3. Project Team

Each project that CfA undertakes will usually consist of the following teams and sub-roles. Each *Senior* role will be responsible for communicating directly with the Executive Team.

NOTE: Senior roles in CfA projects are also contributors. We adopt the approach that the idea and implementation should idealy come from the same person. This then adds integrity to a project build as the contibutors beliefs and energy are engrained into their contributions to the project.
